# LeadSnap

## Repository Link
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/leadsnap)  
*Note: Replace with your actual repository URL.*

## Project Overview
**LeadSnap** is a lead-sharing system that leverages semantic search to help businesses find potential sponsors, partners, or clients quickly. By using a vector database (ChromaDB) and semantic embeddings, the application processes existing lead data to return structured results based on user queries.

### Key Features:
- **Semantic Search:** Uses embeddings to match user queries with relevant lead data.
- **Structured Output:** Returns key lead details such as Company Name, Industry, Sponsorship History, Engagement Score, Contact Status, and Recommended Actions.
- **Interactive UI:** A client-side interface built with React and Next.js that allows real-time search and filtering of leads.
- **Mock Data Integration:** Includes sample lead data for testing and demonstration purposes.

### Problem It Solves:
Businesses often struggle to identify and target the right leads from large data sets. LeadSnap automates this process by providing a streamlined, semantic search interface that presents actionable lead information in a structured format.

## Dependencies
To ensure smooth operation, the project relies on the following tools and libraries:

- **Python 3.x** (e.g., Python 3.9 or later)
- **FastAPI** (for API creation)
- **Uvicorn** (ASGI server for FastAPI)
- **ChromaDB** (for vector storage and semantic search)
- **OpenAI API** or an alternative embedding solution (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- **React** (for the frontend)
- **Next.js** (React framework for SSR/client components)
- **Axios** (for HTTP requests)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Lucide React** (for icons)
- **Other UI Components** (as provided by your custom component libraries)

*Version Details (example):*
- Python: 3.9
- FastAPI: 0.78.0
- Uvicorn: 0.17.0
- chromadb: TBD
- openai: TBD
- React: 18.x
- Next.js: 13.x
- Axios: 0.27.2
- Tailwind CSS: 3.x

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or Yarn) are installed.
- Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed.

### Backend Setup (Python/FastAPI):
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leadsnap.git
   cd leadsnap/server
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables (if needed):**
   - Create a `.env` file and add any required configuration (e.g., API keys, database paths).

6. **Start the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

### Frontend Setup (Next.js/React):
1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Basic Usage:
- **API Testing:** Use Postman or a similar tool to send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/search_leads/` with a JSON payload:
  ```json
  {
    "query": "find companies with automotive sponsorship"
  }
  ```
- **Frontend Interaction:** Use the search bar in the UI to update the query and view corresponding lead results in the table.

## Additional Information
- **Documentation:** TBD
- **Known Issues:** TBD
- **Future Enhancements:** TBD
